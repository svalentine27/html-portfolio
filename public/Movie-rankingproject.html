 <h3>Sprited Away</h3>
 <p>This is one of my favorite movies, I watched this as a kid and just loved the art behind this anime. </p>
 <h3>Passion of the Christ</h3>
 <p>Classic movie about Jesus Christ. Hard to watch at one point but great film.</p>
 <h3>Spider Man 1</h3>
 <p>When I first watched this I was so amazed and fell in love with the cinematic live action storyline. I remember walking out of the movie theaters in shock with how amazing the movie was. </p>
