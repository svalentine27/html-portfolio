<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello future employers! My name is Spencer Valentine. I am a web developer, and since I was young I've been interested in computers.
  I would be the guy that everyone in my family would ask tech questions about and still am. <!--insert should srhug-->
  I have always loved technology and I'm excited to be a part of it. For a while I didn't know exactly what path I wanted to take but as I ventured out in life I disovered 
  that I loved creating things. I took coding classes in high school back in 2012 and I had no idea what it would turn into today and it's now such a massive growing industry.
  Since finding my path I am now purusing a degree in computer science all while learning how to code and developing my skills. 
</p>

<p>I look forward to learning more about web development, building projects, and participating in tech meetups or clubs. I am dedicated to my future success,
  and ecstatic about what I can accomplish.
</p>

<p>Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!</p>
